# Tool to watermark photos

Python3, Pip3 and OpenCV are required to be installed before running the tool. 
Use `pip3 install opencv-python`

It takes all the files from the `photos` directory, adds the watermark (`logo.png` file) and save the resulted files to the `watermarked` dir.

Customize the watermark image as you want.

To run use `python3 watermark.py`
